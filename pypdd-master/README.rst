PyPDD
=====

A Python Positive Degree Day (PDD) model for glacier surface mass-balance.

This module provides a simple model to compute accumulation and melt on a
glacier using near-surface air temperature and precipitation time series. The
model assumes that melt is proportional to the number of positive degree-days,
which corresponds to the integral of temperature above 0°C. Temperature
variability is included by assuming a normal temperature distribution around the
mean. The model optionally includes refreezing of melted snow and ice at the
glacier surface.

PyPDD_ can be used as a module within Python to operate on Numpy_ arrays. In
addition, it reads and writes netCDF_ files directly from the command line, and
provides a raster module for `GRASS GIS`_. The PDD model is based on an
algorithm that was initially developed for the `Parallel Ice Sheet Model`_ and
adopted here with very few changes.


The PDDModel class
------------------

**Requires:** NumPy_, SciPy_.

A PDD model instance can be created by::

   from pypdd import PDDModel
   pdd = PDDModel()

Several model parameters can be set at initialization. See ``help(PDDModel)``
for a list. Provided two arrays ``temp`` and ``prec`` of shape ``(t, x, y)``
containing temperature and precipitation data, the PDD model can be called
with::

   pdd(temp, prec)

This will return a dictionary containing a number of two- and three-dimensional
arrays, including the number of positive degree day ``'pdd'`` and total surface
mass balance ``'smb'``. Temperature variability can be included in a third array
``stdv`` containing temperature standard deviation values::

	pdd(temp, prec, stdv)

If any of ``temp``, ``prec``, or ``stdv`` has shape ``(x, y)``, it will be
interpreted as constant in time and expanded along the time dimension. Floats
with be interpreted as constant in time and space and expanded along all
dimensions.

NetCDF interface
----------------

**Requires:** netCDF4-Python_.

The PDDModel class holds a netCDF operator, which can be called by::

   pdd.nco('input.nc', 'output.nc')

The file ``'input.nc'`` should contain temperatures and precipitation in
variables ``'temp'`` and ``'prec'``. The calculated number of positive degree
days and total surface mass balance are stored in variables ``'pdd'`` and
``'smb'`` of ``'output.nc'``. Keyword argument ``output_size`` or
``output_variables`` can be used to produce more output.

The netCDF interface can be used directly from the command line by executing the
module as a script::

   python2 pypdd.py -i 'input.nc' -o 'output.nc'

If no input file is provided, an artificial climate will be generated under
``atm.nc`` and used by the model. By default, output is saved as ``smb.nc``.
Many more command-line options are available. For an overview type::

   python2 pypdd.py --help


GRASS GIS interface
-------------------

**Requires:** `GRASS GIS`_.

PyPDD can also operate on GRASS raster maps using the attached module ``r.pdd``.
Temperature, precipitation and standard deviation maps should be provided as
comma-separated lists::

   r.pdd.py temp=list,of,temp,maps prec=list,of,prec,maps pdd=pdd_map smb=smb_map

All time-independent PyPDD output variables can currently be exported as raster
maps. Alike any other GRASS module, a graphical prompt can be invoked by calling
``r.pdd`` without arguments, and a list of options can be obtained with::

   r.pdd.py --help
